# Instacart Market Basket Analysis using PySpark & Pandas
This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow on Instacart order data. The data was initially stored in MySQL, extracted using SQL queries, downloaded as .csv files, 
and then imported into Python for further processing. To handle large datasets efficiently, the data was converted into Parquet format and processed using PySpark.

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand product reorder behavior and top-selling categories

- Analyze customer order habits by time, basket size, and frequency

- Identify one-time vs repeat buyers and power users

- Provide actionable business insights based on historical order data

## 📥 Data Flow & Processing
- Data Source: Extracted from MySQL using SQL queries

- Data Export: Saved relational tables as .csv files on local machine

- Data Optimization: Converted .csv files into .parquet format for faster loading

- Processing Tool: Used PySpark for scalable data transformation and analysis

- Visualization: Used Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for plots and summaries

⚠️ Due to the large size of the dataset, the actual data files are not included in this repository. Refer to the data/README.md for download instructions.
